This is a little QoL mod that displays explosion radius on all explosives on selection and placing.

I would expect it to be compatible with most mods. However it doesn't quite work with Combat Extended yet.

Feedback is welcome. Please leave a comment if you spot any issues or have any suggestions! Hope you like it.
